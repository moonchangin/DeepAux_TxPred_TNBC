# DeepAux_TxPred_TNBC
This repository contains code and data for applying deep auxiliary task reweighting learning methods to improve treatment response prediction for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). By leveraging transcriptomics data from clinical trials, the study explores the use of auxiliary learning techniques—such as ARML, AdaLoss, GradNorm, and OL_AUX—to enhance the predictive accuracy of models. These methods are benchmarked against traditional supervised learning and single-task learning baselines, demonstrating superior performance in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) in TNBC patients, even with limited data.
